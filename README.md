# Sentimental-analysis-PythonT
The sentiment analysis model using logistic regression and count vectorization techniques to classify Amazon reviews 
as positive or negative based on their sentiment. This approach leverages the power of machine learning and natural 
language processing to extract meaningful insights from customer reviews, aiding businesses in making informed decisions 
to enhance customer satisfaction and product quality.

The chosen sentiment analysis approach employs logistic regression, a statistical technique used for binary classification tasks, such as sentiment classification. The goal of this model is to predict whether a given review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The model is trained on a dataset of Amazon reviews, with each review labeled as positive or negative based on the sentiment it conveys.

Count vectorization is employed as the text representation technique. Count vectorization converts text data into numerical form by creating a matrix where each row corresponds to a document (in this case, a review), and each column corresponds to a unique word from the entire corpus of reviews. The matrix's cells contain the frequency of each word's occurrence in the corresponding document
